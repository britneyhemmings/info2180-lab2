                As the world globalizes and technology continues to grow, educational institutions aim to prepare their students for this modernized world by integrating technology within their classrooms. 
                It is now a priority that schools are equipped with several computer labs and has available internet access around their campuses. 
                The same goes for homes, especially since COVID-19 has shown us all that classrooms can now be remote. 
                It is often believed that the use of technology intensifies and makes learning easier for students. Let's take a look at some of the benefits of using ICT tools in education.
                
            </p>

                ICT broadens their minds and encourages teaching oneself - Having access to a plethora of free information on the internet exposes students to knowledge outside of what they learn in school. 
                It allows them to discover new interests. It provides a struggling student with the opportunity to find resources that cater to their learning style (which is something that may not always happen in a regular classroom). 
                A YouTube video explaining how to find derivatives may just be the solution to a Calculus student who has been struggling with grasping the topic in class.

                ICT improves engagement - Learning with the traditional teacher writing on a blackboard or a lecturer just talking can get boring. 
                Students disengage when they are bored. 
                Therefore, when technology is integrated into lessons, it stimulates learning since it makes the learning process more exciting for students.
                Additionally, technology provides a variety of ways to teach the same things differently. 
                For instance, delivering teaching through YouTube videos and gamification using platforms such as Kahoot, Quizzizz , Quizlet and even a simple poll on Zoom. 
                This improved engagement may also help students to retain knowledge. 
                Some students find listening a song about a topic repeatedly more effective in retaining knowledge than reading a text book full of paragraphs.

            <h2> Disadvantages of Utilizing ICT Tools in Education</h2>

                In yesterday's post we discussed some of the pros of integrating ICT tools in teaching and learning.
                However, it must be noted that technology has a trend of impacting individuals negatively also. Today we will take a look at some of the cons.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Easy access to the internet limits students' ability to think for themselves - students have become heavily dependent on technology to get work done. 
                Additionally, a report done by the Pew Research Center found that students were less likely to retain specific information knowing that they had future access to the information.
                Hence, they become dependent on technology to complete assignments. 
                Therefore, there is a suggestion that students will become unproductive in the absence of technology. 
                Additionally, technology can limit the amount of mentally keen and alerted students produced.                             
            </p>

            <p>
                Limits socialization and facilitates social anxiety - Studies have proposed that social networking disconnects individuals from each other.
                Students that spend a lot of time on devices may not spend as much time interacting with their peers or see the need to interact with them. 
                Many enjoy socializing online but struggle to socialize in person. 
                For example, a student may rather send a message to a teacher asking for help rather than raising their hand in class to state the same.
